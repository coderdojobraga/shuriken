## :warning: Dirty hacks you should be aware of

Through no fault of your own (of course :wink:), the following hacks (or, as we prefer to call them: unconventional programming techniques) made their way into our code. **If you want to potentially save yourself some hours of bug hunting**, we recommend you read this section.

### :arrow_right: Ant Design theme customization

This project uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for the styling of its authenticated pages.

Unfortunately for us, Ant requires LESS support for theme customization and NextJS doesn't support it.

To solve this, we adapted the npm scripts to always compile the necessary LESS files before starting a build or a development server. This means that any changes made the the Ant theme will trigger a build in a development server; you have to restart it to see the effects.

For more information refer to [PR #30](https://github.com/coderdojobraga/shuriken/pull/30).
